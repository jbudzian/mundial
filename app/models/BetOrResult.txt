you can run heroku run rake assets:clean or heroku run rake assets:precompile

bundle install
bundle exec rspec spec/
bundle exec rake db:migrate
bundle exec rake db:test:prepare
bundle exec rake assets:precompile

git add .
git commit -m "Finish user signup"
git checkout master
git merge sign-up

git commit -a -m "Add SSL in production"
git push heroku

heroku restart

heroku run rake db:migrate
heroku open
heroku logs

heroku run rake assets:reset
heroku run rake assets:precompile
heroku restart

rake assets:clean
